#The KEVI-A Linux Assistant v-1.0  performs the following tasks at this momenet

1.Opens terminal with voice command "open terminal", simalary sublime text with command "open sublime text"
2.Opens calculator
3.Open my github repository
4.open youtube,google
5.Send email
6.Display top news headlines via news api
7.Talk with GROQ
8.Display jokes

The voice feature for the assistant could not be implemented due to my audio hardware isssues.So
instead KEVI responses back with exceuting task automatically and printing on the screen(used in place of
voice)
